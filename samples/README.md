# Sample extensions

Here some sample extensions for tests.

With the new system, introduced in 2021.01.xx, the Extension to use  is `SampleExtension.zip` (in all installations).

The old ones (`geOrchestraSampleExtension.zip`, `SampleMapStoreExtension.zip` are valid for old versions of MapStore).
**Note: geOrchestraSampleExtension.zip is not compatible with MapStore, as well as SampleMapStoreExtension.zip is not compatible with geOrchestra.**
