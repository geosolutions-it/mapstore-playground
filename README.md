A sample mapstore project
=========================

This is a sample MapStore project ready to use, with some examples and exercises. An good way to start playing with MapStore friendly. 


Quick Start
------------

Minimal requirements: 
- **NodeJS** version >= 8 
- **npm**  version >= 5

Clone the repository with the --recursive option to automatically clone submodules:

`git clone --recursive http://github.com/geosolutions-it/mapstore-playground`

Running the application locally:

- `cd mapstore-playground`

- `npm install`

- `npm start`

The application runs at `http://localhost:8081` afterwards.

*notes*: 
To simplify as much as possible the first running set-up the application is connected the back-end service available at https://dev.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/. If you are experiencing some problems running the application please check if the default back-end services are running (some down-time can happen). 

If you have more problems, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/mapstore-playground/issues/new) to notify the problem. 

Instructions about setting up locally the back-end services are coming soon...
